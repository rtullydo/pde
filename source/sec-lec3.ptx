  <subsection xml:id="subsec-diffusion">
    <title>Diffusion</title>
    <p>Imagine a drop of food coloring placed in a glass of water. The dye spreads out, or <em>diffuses</em> into the liquid. The <em>diffusion equation</em> describes how this happens. Many physical processes can be modeled by diffusion, probably most notably the transfer of heat in a medium. </p>
      
    <p>We will derive a simple diffusion equation in one variable. Imagine a thin tube arranged along the <m>x</m>-axis filled with a static liquid. Let <m>u(x,t)</m> be the mass concentration of dye in the tube at position <m>x</m> at time <m>t</m>. A simple physical observation is that the dye moves in the liquid at a rate proportional to the concetration gradient at a given point. Fix a small segment of the tube between two positions <m>x_0, x_1</m>. The mass of dye in the small segment is 
      <me>
        M(t) = \int_{x_0}^{x_1} u(x,t) \, dx.
      </me>
    This gives
      <me>
        \frac{dM}{dt} = \int_{x_0}^{x_1} u_t(x, t) \, dx.  
      </me>
    On the other hand, 
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{dM}{dt} \amp = \text{flow in - flow out} </mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = k u_x(x_1, t) - k u_x(x_0, t)  </mrow>
      </md>
      as flow is proportional to the contentration gradient.
    </p>

    <p>
      Equating these expressions for <m>dM/dt</m>, we see 
      <me>
        \int_{x_0}^{x_1} u_t(x, t) \, dx = k u_x(x_1, t) - k u_x(x_0).
      </me>
      Now take the derivative of this expression with respect to <m>x_1</m> and apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which gives
      <me>
        u_t(x_1, t) = k u_{x x_1}(x_1, t) 
      </me>
      and make the observation that this is equivalent to 
      <me>
        u_t = k u_{xx}.
      </me>

        <title>Simple diffusion in 1D</title>
        <p>
          The <em>simple diffusion equation</em> or <em>heat equation</em> on the line is 
          <me>
            u_t = k u_{xx}.
          </me>
          
        </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let's do it again, but this time in 3D. Instead of a small segment of a tube, imagine a small sphere in 3D space, with the interior ball denoted <m>D</m> and the boundary sphere <m>\partial D</m>. The mass concentration of the dye is given by <m>u(x, y, z, t)</m> at position <m>x, y, z</m> and time <m>t</m>. The mass of dye inside <m>D</m> is
        <me>
          M(t) = \iiint_D u(x, y, z, t)\, dV,
        </me>
        and as before 
        <me>
          \frac{dM}{dt} = \iiint_D u_t \, dV.
        </me>
        As in the 1D case, we'll make the simplfying assumption that the movement of the dye inside <m>D</m> is proportional to the concentration gradient with constant <m>k</m>, but this time we need to account for all of the boundary points in <m>\partial D</m>. At each point in <m>\partial D</m>, choose an outward normal vector <m>n</m>. Then the flux of dye through the surface locally at a point <m>(x, y, z)\in \partial D</m> is proportional to the outward concentration gradient through the surface area unit <m>dS</m>, which we can write as the expression <m>k (n \cdot \nabla u) \, dS</m>. To add up the net change in mass, we get
        <me>
          \frac{dM}{dt} = \iint_{\partial D} k(n \cdot \nabla u)\, dS.
        </me>
        As before, we set the two expressions for <m>dM/dt</m> equal to get
        <me>
          \iiint_D u_t \, dV = \iint_{\partial D} k(n \cdot \nabla u)\, dS.
        </me>
        Now apply the divergence theorem.
        <assemblage xml:id="assemblage-divthm">
          <title>Divergence theorem</title>
          <p>
          Given a solid region <m>D</m> with closed boundary surface <m>\partial D</m>, an outward normal <m>n</m> to <m>\partial D</m> and a <m>C^1</m> function <m>F</m>, 
          <me>
            \iiint_{D} \nabla \cdot F \, dV = \iint_{\partial D} (F \cdot n) \, dS.
          </me>
          </p>
        </assemblage>
        Then
          <md>
          <mrow>\iiint_D u_t \, dV \amp = \iint_{\partial D} k(n \cdot \nabla u)\, dS  </mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = \iiint_D \nabla \cdot k\nabla u \, dV</mrow> 
          <mrow>\amp = \iiint_D k \nabla \cdot \nabla u \, dV </mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = \iiint_D k (u_{xx} + u_{yy} + u_{zz})\, dV</mrow>
        </md> 
        Then we conclude (invoking A LOT of high level math) that since
        <me>
          \iiint_D u_t \, dV = \iiint_D k (u_{xx} + u_{yy} + u_{zz})\, dV
        </me>
        for any small ball <m>D</m> that 
        <me>
          u_t = k (u_{xx} + u_{yy} + u_{zz}) = k \Delta u.
